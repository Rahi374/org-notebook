;;; Commentary:

;; The main function is org-notebook-insert-image
;; Bind this to a convenient key combination
;;
;; There is also org-notebook-new-notebook
;; This creates a directory with the name of the
;; notebook you provide, and then creates
;; a notebook.org file and an img directory in it.
;; It populates the notebook.org file with org
;; headers, asking you for a title only since
;; the author, email, and language are extracted
;; automatically.
;;
;; For customization there is:
;;
;; org-notebook-drawing-program
;; By default this is set to kolourpaint
;; This determines what image-drawing program
;; will be launched when org-notebook-insert-image
;; is called.
;;
;; org-notebook-image-type
;; By default this is set to png
;; This determines the default filetype that
;; the drawn diagrams will be saved and linked.
;;
;; org-notebook-language
;; By default this is set to en
;; This determines the language org header that
;; will be inserted when org-notebook-new-notebook
;; is called.
;;
;; org-notebook-image-width
;; By default this is set to 600
;; This determines the image width org header that
;; will be inserted when org-notebook-new-notebook
;; is called. The header determines the width that
;; the images will be displayed in in org-mode.
;;
;; org-notebook-headers
;; By default this is an empty list
;; This is a list of cons where the first element
;; of each con is the header name (eg. LATEX_CLASS,
;; HTML_HEAD, etc) and the second element of each
;; con is the value of the header. These will be
;; inserted into the notebook org file when
;; org-notebook-new-notebook is called.
